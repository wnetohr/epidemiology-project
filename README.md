### ðŸ”¬ SEIRD Epidemiological Model Dashboard

This interactive and accessible tool aims to provide an understanding of the dynamics of high-impact epidemics, such as COVID-19 and measles, through the implementation of a **SEIRD model**. The web application, developed in **Python** and the **Streamlit** framework , allows users to adjust epidemiological parameters and visualize the evolution of the disease on an intuitive dashboard.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Interactive Simulation**: The application allows users to define and adjust key epidemiological parameters , such as infection, incubation, recovery, and mortality rates.
* **Intuitive Dashboard**: The simulation results are presented on a dashboard , which includes line graphs showing the number of individuals in each state (SuscetÃ­vel, Exposto, Infectado, Recuperado, Morto) over time.
* **Data Visualization**: The dashboard provides other relevant graphics for analyzing the simulated scenario and offers tools to aid in the analysis and interpretation of the data generated by the simulations.
* **Objective-Driven Design**: The tool was built with the main objective of implementing the SEIRD model to simulate the dynamics of epidemics.

#### **Access the Application**
