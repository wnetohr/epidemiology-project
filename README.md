### ðŸ”¬ SEIRD Epidemiological Model Dashboard

[cite_start]This interactive and accessible tool aims to provide an understanding of the dynamics of high-impact epidemics, such as COVID-19 and measles, through the implementation of a **SEIRD model**[cite: 9, 14]. [cite_start]The web application, developed in **Python** and the **Streamlit** framework [cite: 10, 15][cite_start], allows users to adjust epidemiological parameters and visualize the evolution of the disease on an intuitive dashboard[cite: 15, 23].

#### **Key Features:**

* [cite_start]**Interactive Simulation**: The application allows users to define and adjust key epidemiological parameters [cite: 21][cite_start], such as infection, incubation, recovery, and mortality rates[cite: 46, 47, 48, 49].
* [cite_start]**Intuitive Dashboard**: The simulation results are presented on a dashboard [cite: 16][cite_start], which includes line graphs showing the number of individuals in each state (SuscetÃ­vel, Exposto, Infectado, Recuperado, Morto) over time[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization**: The dashboard provides other relevant graphics for analyzing the simulated scenario [cite: 16] [cite_start]and offers tools to aid in the analysis and interpretation of the data generated by the simulations[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Objective-Driven Design**: The tool was built with the main objective of implementing the SEIRD model to simulate the dynamics of epidemics[cite: 18].
