ðŸ”¬ SEIRD Epidemiological Model Dashboard
This interactive and accessible tool aims to provide an understanding of the dynamics of high-impact epidemics, such as COVID-19 and measles, through the implementation of a 

SEIRD model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, Deceased).


Developed as a web application using 

Python and the Streamlit framework, this project serves as a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing disease propagation.



Key Features:

Interactive Simulation: Users can easily adjust key epidemiological parameters, such as infection, incubation, recovery, and mortality rates.



Intuitive Dashboard: The application presents the simulation results through a clear and easy-to-understand dashboard.



Data Visualization: Includes line graphs showing the evolution of the population across different compartments (S, E, I, R, D) over time, as well as other relevant metrics for analysis.


Objective-Driven Design: The tool was built with the goal of facilitating the analysis and comprehension of data generated by the simulations.
